              <p>
                My name is Ebrahim Ghanbari, and I am a software developer based
                in Canada.
              </p>
              <h2>How did I draw into coding?</h2>
              <p>
                I started my professional career as a Data Analyst at
                Weatherford instrumentation group. love being challenged. With
                pandemic and lockdown, I saw it as a good opportunity to improve
                my programming skills through Lighthouse Lab Web Development
                bootcamp. Working and studying full time was a real challenge
                but I really enjoyed taking my programming skills to the next
                level. Through bootcamp and self-learning, I have developed
                intimate knowledge of Node.js, React and Test-Driven Development
                practice.
              </p>
              <h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
              <p></p>
              <h2>About this website?</h2>
              <p>
                The website was built and designed by myself. For the backend I
                have used Express and MongoDB and Front-End is designed using
                React. I am hosting this website using a 10+ years old laptop.
